## üçÑ Social Account Abstraction Recovery and Management

Experience the future of social account abstraction recovery - where accessibility meets security, and your Ethereum identity is never out of reach.

Applicaton provides GraphQL API and command-line interface for managing recovery process of your ethereum-based account-abstraction smart contract in case your keys are compromized or you cannot get access to keys.

This is proof-of-concept of socio-technical mechanics related to account recovery 

## Feature list

 - [x] Social Recovery via your friends social network accounts
 - [ ] Freeze your account via Telegram bot (and unfreeze with private keys which are not compromised)
 - [ ] Storing recovery process state onchain (or in decentralized storages like IPFS)
 - [ ] Different wallets (accounts) with transaction amount limits
 - [ ] Web UI for social recovery
 - [ ] Moblie UI for social recovery

## Assumtions and requirements

1. SRA can use different entropy sources for hash generation, for PoC we use hash from google account ID 
2. SRA is not required to use ethereum wallet 

## User flow description
1. Create Account Abstraction (AA) wallet
    - Add you alerting keys
    - Deploy AA smart into blockchain
    - Add backup access key if needed
3. Add social recovery agents (SRA)
    - Ask your frend to generate hash from some data only he knows (in current example we use hash from)
    - Whrite hash from SRA's hash to smart contract
5. (...You lost access to your keys or compromise it...) 
6. Press alert button to block you account
    - User asks somebody with alert keys to sent alert transaction to your AA wallet
    - OR get access to your backup wallet to block compromised address
8. Start recovering process by asking social recovery agents for their social data
    - Go to your friends (only you know the list of them)
    - Ask them to genereate hash from their social data
    - Store it somewhere (your wallet with recovery feature?)
10. User change access wallet 

Simple lightweight template for a backend applications, based on [NestJS](https://nestjs.com).
[Prisma.io](https://www.prisma.io) and SQLite uses as base for data storage (Postgres and others DBMS available too).

## üìÉ Get started (TL;DR)

```shell
# Init project
$ npx liteend-cli new <project-name>

# Deploy database: 
$ npm run db:migrations:apply

# Seed DB: 
$ npm run db:seed

# Development run: 
$ npm run start:dev

# Production build: 
$ npm run build

# Production run: 
$ npm start:prod
```

### ü•° Docker-compose

To launch the project in a Docker container, run the command `docker-compose up -d`

### üì¶ Database workflow

```shell
# Edit schema: 
$ prisma/schema.prisma

# Format schema: 
$ npm run db:schema:format

# Create migration: 
$ npm run db:migrations:create

# Deploy migrations to database: 
$ npm run db:migrations:apply
```

> More info about using Prisma: https://www.prisma.io

#### üîë Database admin panel in docker

The project has an admin panel configured to work with the database, available by default on the `5000`
port: http://localhost:5000

**Important:** In production mode, be sure to set up a password for the database admin page

## üçÄ Code quality

> TL;DR: Run `npm run check` before **every** commit

### ‚úÖ Tests

```shell
# unit tests
$ npm run test

# e2e tests
$ npm run test:e2e

# test coverage
$ npm run test:cov
```

The project has [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) configured, which checks the code for errors and warnings, and See
also `tsconfig.json` for proper assembly and compilation of types. To check the code for errors and warnings - run the
command `npm run check`.
Prettier is also configured to format the code, run `npm run format` to format the code (but ESLint will still check it)
.
